# discord-ffxiv-news

A simple Discord bot for posting the latest news from the Final Fantasty XIV Lodestone to channels. 

Big props to [XIVDB](http://www.xivdb.com) for providing an awesome API that makes this possible.

If you want to use it, do `npm install`, set the `DISCORD_BOT_SECRET` environment variable appropriately and change the `CHANNEL_NAME` variable to whatever you want.

I'm not sure what the etiquette is for bots that post independently(i.e without listening for commands) so that's why I have the `CHANNEL_NAME` config.
